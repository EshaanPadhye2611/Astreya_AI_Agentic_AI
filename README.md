 🌆 Astreya AI – The Living Pulse of Smart Cities

 🔍 Problem Statement

Modern cities like Bengaluru generate massive amounts of unstructured, noisy, and rapidly outdated data — from traffic disruptions and civic complaints to hyperlocal events and social media posts. This data is often:

- Siloed across platforms
- Redundant and hard to verify
- Difficult to synthesize into actionable insights
